Experiment 1: Evaluation of MLaaS Perfromace Drift Detection approach

File Name 1 : Experiment_1_PMDD_Framework_HAR_Dataset_Final_v2.ipynb
Overview
--------
- Detects performance drift in Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) systems.
- Uses Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset as a test environment.
- Focuses on detecting accuracy degradation over time caused by data drift.

Key Components
--------------
1. Drift Injection
   - Introduces artificial drift (sudden, gradual, incremental) into data streams.
   - Helps simulate real-world IoT data changes such as user behavior or sensor shifts.

2. MLaaS Extraction Model
   - Learns the behavior of a black-box MLaaS provider.
   - Trained on input–output pairs to mimic service prediction patterns.
   - Detects hidden performance changes without internal access.

3. Ground Truth Evaluation
   - Compares MLaaS predictions against true labels to measure drift impact.
   - Computes accuracy, detection delay, and false negative metrics.

Workflow
--------
- Load original HAR dataset.
- Add synthetic drift to simulate changes.
- Train the MLaaS extraction model.
- Evaluate against the ground truth.
- Visualize drift detection and performance results.

Outputs
-------
- Plots showing drift detection over time.
- Summary metrics including accuracy degradation and detection delay.

Requirements
------------
- Python 3.9 or later
- Required libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn, tensorflow or torch.

File Name 2 : Experiment_1_PMDD_Framework_Electricity_Dataset.ipynb

Overview
--------
- Demonstrates the PMDD (Performance Drift Detection) framework using the Electricity dataset.
- Detects changes in model performance when the data distribution shifts due to varying electricity prices and demand conditions.
- Focuses on identifying both real and pseudo drift events in MLaaS environments where model internals are inaccessible.

Key Components
--------------
1. Drift Injection
   - Introduces synthetic drift into the electricity market data stream.
   - Mimics real-world data variation caused by market fluctuations, seasonal demand, and consumption patterns.

2. MLaaS Extraction Model
   - Builds a lightweight surrogate model that learns the mapping between electricity input features (price, demand, etc.) and MLaaS predictions.
   - Used to observe prediction changes over time, reflecting how MLaaS behaviour evolves with data drift.

3. Ground Truth Evaluation
   - Compares MLaaS predictions with the actual electricity price direction (up/down) to compute drift performance.
   - Measures accuracy degradation, detection delay, and rate of false alarms (pseudo drift).

Workflow
--------
- Load and preprocess the Electricity dataset.
- Inject synthetic drift across selected time intervals.
- Train the MLaaS extraction model to mimic service predictions.
- Continuously monitor predictions and compare them against the ground truth.
- Identify and classify drift events as real or pseudo.

Outputs
-------
- Visualization plots showing drift intervals, detected drift points, and changes in model performance.
- Summary logs reporting detection time, window sensitivity, and drift classification.
- Comparative metrics between adaptive and fixed detection intervals.

Requirements
------------
- Python 3.9 or later
- Required libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn, tensorflow or torch.
