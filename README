Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is a powerful cloud ser-
vice that enables data-driven intelligent applications in Internet
of Things (IoT) environments. Many IoT applications across smart
healthcare, transportation, homes, cities, and industry rely on MLaaS
due to its cost-effectiveness. The dynamic nature of IoT causes fre-
quent changes in data distribution, and characteristics affect the
stability of MLaaS performance. Moreover, MLaaS providers peri-
odically update can further impact the predictive accuracy of the
service and cause performance drift. Unlike traditional ML, devel-
opers can retrain with access to data and parameters. MLaaS clients
are black-box users without this control, making performance drift
detection particularly challenging. To address this, we propose a
novel MLaaS performance drift detection framework for IoT envi-
ronments. The framework first employs an MLaaS extraction model
that learns the provider’s behaviour from input–output pairs, reveal-
ing prediction-influenced features of MLaaS. Building on this, we
propose a novel MLaaS Performance Drift Detection (MPDD) model
that jointly captures changes in input data and MLaaS behaviour.
We introduce the Adaptive-Temporal Performance Drift Detection
mechanism (APDDM), which is a variable interval mechanism to
balance oversensitivity and oundersensitivity. Experimental results
on real-world datasets show the proposed MPDD achieves up to
15–20% higher accuracy and ATDDM achieves 50% fewer missed
detections rate than benchmark drift methods for IoT environments
