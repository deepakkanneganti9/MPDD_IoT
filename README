Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is a powerful cloud paradigm enabling data-driven intelligent applications in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, widely adopted across healthcare, smart homes, and industry due to its cost-effectiveness. However, the dynamic nature of IoT frequently alters data distributions, affecting MLaaS stability, while periodic MLaaS updates further introduce performance drift. Unlike traditional ML systems, MLaaS clients operate as black-box users without access to internal data or parameters, making drift detection particularly challenging. To address this, we propose a novel MLaaS Performance Drift Detection framework for IoT environments. The framework first employs an MLaaS extraction model that learns service behavior from input–output pairs and identifies prediction-influenced features. Building on this, the proposed MLaaS Performance Drift Detection (MPDD) model jointly captures variations in input data and MLaaS behavior. We further design an Adaptive-Temporal Performance Drift Detection Mechanism (APDDM) that dynamically adjusts monitoring frequency based on behavioral and data variations, enabling timely drift detection for effective service management. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MPDD achieves up to 20–25\% accuracy improvement over baseline drift detection methods, while the adaptive APDDM provides an additional average accuracy gain of approximately 15\% and reduces the miss detection rate by around 10\% compared to fixed-interval monitoring. 

## 📘 Overview

The experiments collectively evaluate:
- **Performance Drift in MLaaS systems** where internal model access is restricted.  
- **Adaptive monitoring mechanisms** that automatically tune drift detection sensitivity.
- **Impact of data drift** (e.g., user behavior, environmental changes, or market variations) on MLaaS prediction accuracy.

The framework leverages **synthetic drift injection**, **MLaaS extraction modeling**, and **ground truth evaluation** to systematically assess detection accuracy, delay, and false alarms.

## ⚙️ Common Workflow

All notebooks follow a consistent experimental workflow:

1. **Load and preprocess dataset**  
   Each dataset (HAR, Electricity, Weather, or Benchmark) is prepared and normalized.

2. **Inject synthetic drift**  
   Drift is introduced artificially to simulate real-world distribution shifts such as:
   - Sudden, gradual, or incremental changes  
   - Seasonal or behavioral variations  

3. **Train MLaaS Extraction Model**  
   - A lightweight surrogate model learns the mapping between inputs and MLaaS predictions.  
   - Used to observe **black-box behaviour** and detect hidden performance degradation.

4. **Evaluate Performance Drift**  
   - Compare MLaaS predictions with true labels.  
   - Compute metrics: accuracy degradation, detection delay, false positives, and pseudo drift rate.

5. **Visualize Results**  
   - Plots showing drift points, detection timelines, and adaptive interval variations.  
   - Summary tables with comparative metrics.
